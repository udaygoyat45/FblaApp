    <h1 class="bebas">Optimize Your Miles</h1>
    <p class="b612 mb-4">
        The key to using frequent flyer programs is accumulating miles and redeeming them according to your needs,
        sometimes called â€œearn and burn."

        The fundamental way to rack up points is by flying our airline. We have switched our plan, and now points are
        given based on money you spend instead of total miles travelled.
        The basic way to rack up miles is by flying the airline.
